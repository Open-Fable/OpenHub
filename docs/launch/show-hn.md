Show HN: OpenHub – One macOS app for chat, code agents, design, and orchestration
```

**Body:**

```
Hi HN,

I built OpenHub, a free macOS desktop app that puts five AI tools in one sidebar:
a chat (any model), a multi-agent orchestrator, and three open-source tools —
OpenCode (sst), OpenWork (different-ai), and Open Design (nexu-io).

The key ideas:

- You enter your API keys once (stored in macOS Keychain, never on disk).
  A local proxy on 127.0.0.1:9999 routes to Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter,
  Ollama, or Gemini. All three tools share that proxy — no per-app configuration.

- The upstream apps run unmodified. All customization is CSS/JS injection
  from an overrides layer, so upstream updates don't break anything.

- The orchestrator takes a goal ("build me a landing page"), generates a DAG
  of agents (planner, coder, designer, verifier), and produces a real
  deliverable with file extraction. Think multi-agent CI for creative work.

- Persistent memory and per-project context that carry across sessions.

- Zero Docker, zero cloud — everything runs as native macOS processes.

Stack: Electron + TypeScript + Express proxy + keytar (Keychain).

Would love feedback on the architecture and the orchestrator engine.
