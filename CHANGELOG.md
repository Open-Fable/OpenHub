## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-15

First public release. A macOS desktop shell unifying three open-source AI tools.

### Added

- **Electron shell** with a 3-slot sidebar (Work, Code, Design) plus Chat,
  Orchestrator and Config, each view isolated in a state-preserving
  `WebContentsView`.
- **Unified LLM proxy** on `127.0.0.1:9999` (OpenAI-compatible, Bearer required)
  routing to Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama and Google Gemini.
- **Secret storage in the macOS Keychain** (`keytar`) — never on disk;
  the apps only receive a fake local token.
- **Built-in chat**: model selector, per-model reasoning effort,
  saved history, web search, attachments, project context.
- **Multi-agent orchestrator**: iterative planning, execution of a DAG of
  agents (code / design / work / pure LLM / verification), deterministic
  quality gates and retry on error.
- **Project management**: standalone projects and orchestrator projects, with
  custom instructions injected into the AI context.
- **Persistent memory**: profile, tagged facts, auto-extraction and token budget.
- **Override layer** (CSS/JS) per app — upstream source code is never
  modified, which preserves compatibility with updates.
- **Prefix caching optimization** in the proxy to reduce cost and latency.
- **Tooling**: automated setup (`scripts/setup.sh`), `npm run update:apps`,
  `npm run check:selectors`, Vitest + Playwright tests, CI lint & typecheck.

### Security

- Locked-down WebViews (`contextIsolation`, `sandbox`, no `nodeIntegration`).
- `opencode serve` bound strictly to `127.0.0.1` with a generated session
  password, never logged.
- Minimal `contextBridge` bridge, with no disk path parameter.
